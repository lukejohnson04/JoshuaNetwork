# JoshuaNetwork

JoshuaNetwork is an impressive next step in a world where a new social media platform takes the world by storm every year. Featuring posts, comments, likes, and followers like many other platforms, JoshuaNetwork does not stop there.

## Random Daily Prompts

Staying in your own little internet bubbles can be fun, but it sure can get old! JoshuaNetwork offers the opportunity to keep things fresh every day, with unique daily prompts, weekly prompts, and monthly prompts, as well as a weekly random post character limit! JoshuaNetwork also features an emoji of the week that awards the post with the most UpJoshuas containing it at the end of the week!
