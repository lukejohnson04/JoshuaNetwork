# JoshuaNetwork

JoshuaNetwork is an impressive next step in a world where a new social media platform takes the world by storm every year. There is both a following homepage with content from every account you're following, and a trending page of the best content across the site. Featuring posts, comments, likes, and followers like many other platforms, JoshuaNetwork does not stop there.

There is also a Hall of Shame on the site, to highlight the worst of the worst content and accounts! All in good fun, of course.
